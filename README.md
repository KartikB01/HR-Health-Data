# HR-Health-Data

This is a data analysis project that involved working on HR Data about the health statistics of the employees and the impact on absenteeism.
I started off by cleaning the data, understanding the different data sets and then writing queries to extract the necessary data in a table format.
Next, I uploaded the newly formed table onto Power BI and created an interactive dashboard that explores the possible variables behind absenteeism in the employees and trying to find insights from the results.
